# IMDB-sentiment-analysis-using-neural-networks

In this project, we explore Recurrent Neural Networks and its variants to predict sentiments for a list of movie reviews. We implement vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU and find a good model by trying out different hyperparameters, optimizer, loss function, number of epochs.

The code, experiments, results and explanations can be found in the jupyter notebook.
